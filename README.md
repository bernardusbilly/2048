### 2048 Game
I developed my own representation of the 2048 game with Java. It adapts the original gameplay that with a ratio 9 to 10 it will generate a random 2/4 number in the current board. Further addition to the game is I developed my own AI with expectimax algorithm with my own heuristic function. After running a test of 1000 game, it achieves 60% getting a score of 1024. Currently I have several more optimization where I have not implement yet.

### Version
